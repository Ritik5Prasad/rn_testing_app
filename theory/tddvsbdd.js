// Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) and Test-Driven Development (TDD) are both software development practices that emphasize the importance of testing. However, they have distinct approaches and focuses. Here are the key differences:

// Test-Driven Development (TDD)
// Focus:

// TDD focuses on writing tests before writing the actual code. The primary goal is to ensure the correctness of the code from a developer’s perspective.
// Process:

// Write a Test: Developers write a test for a small piece of functionality.
// Run the Test: Initially, the test will fail since the functionality is not yet implemented.
// Write the Code: Developers write the minimal amount of code required to pass the test.
// Refactor: The code is then refactored for optimization and cleanliness.
// Repeat: This cycle (Red-Green-Refactor) is repeated for each new piece of functionality.
// Test Level:

// TDD mainly focuses on unit tests, which test individual components or functions in isolation.
// Language:

// Tests in TDD are typically written in the same programming language as the application code.
// Examples:

// Writing a test for a function that calculates the sum of two numbers.
// Ensuring a method in a class behaves correctly under various conditions.
// Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)
// Focus:

// BDD extends TDD by emphasizing the behavior of the application from the user's perspective. It encourages collaboration between developers, testers, and business stakeholders.
// Process:

// Define User Stories: Requirements are captured as user stories that describe the desired behavior from an end-user’s perspective.
// Write Scenarios: Each user story includes scenarios written in a structured format (Given-When-Then) to describe the behavior in different contexts.
// Automate Scenarios: These scenarios are then automated as tests, often using BDD frameworks.
// Test Level:

// BDD focuses on both unit tests and higher-level tests such as integration and acceptance tests. It ensures that the software behaves correctly in real-world scenarios.
// Language:

// BDD encourages writing tests in natural language (using tools like Cucumber or SpecFlow) to make them understandable to non-technical stakeholders.
// Examples:

// Writing a scenario for a login feature that describes the behavior when a user enters valid credentials.
// Ensuring that a shopping cart feature works correctly when items are added or removed.
